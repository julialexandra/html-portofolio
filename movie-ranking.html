<h1>Best Series According to Julia</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Favorite Series</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Gossip Girl</h3>
<p>This is a classic one. I never get tired of it, except the Serena-Dan pairing. They are so corny.</p>
<h3>The Office</h3>
<p>There is literally not much to say. Everyone loves Michael Scott. And those endless fights between Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute.</p>
<h3>Blacklist</h3>
<p>This is my all time favorite crime showwwwww.</p>
